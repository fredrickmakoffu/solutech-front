# Solutech Front end

This is the front-end code built on Vuejs that, together with its backen code, makes up a small project for orders with vehicles.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```

```

### Quick Setup

When you start up the backend server, please note the port where the app runs, and on the front-end app in the main.js file, find the 'axios.defaults.baseURL' variable and make sure the port is 8000. If not, update the port in the main.js file to the new port, e.g., locahost:{new-port}
